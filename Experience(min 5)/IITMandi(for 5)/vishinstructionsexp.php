    <b>Welcome to this study!</b><br></p></center>
<p><left>Please consider a casino which is offering a game in which you can toss a coin multiple times. In the sampling phase, you can toss the coin as many times as you desire to find out the winning from the game. Each outcome you get in the coin toss will not affect your final earnings from the game. In each game, you will start with an initial amount of INR 2. In case a head comes upon tossing the coin (clicking the red button), then you will continue winning in the game. However, if a tail comes upon tossing the coin, then your game will be over and you will be shown the total amount that you won in the game. Once your game is over, you may play the game again. Once you are satisfied with your game play, you may play the casino game for real by clicking the “Play for real” button (you need to toss the coin at least once before you can play the game for real).. Once you click the “Play for real” button, you will be taken to the final-choice phase where you will be asked to play this game for real. Your goal in this study is to maximize your earnings from the casino. You will be given INR 5 for participation upon completing this study. Furthermore, based upon the final earnings obtained, top 10 participants will enter a lucky draw. In the lucky draw, three random participants will get Amazon gift cards of INR 300, INR 200, and INR 100. To be eligible for the lucky draw, please try to get as high an earning as possible from the casino. Best of luck!
